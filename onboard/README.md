# COUNTERPILOT ONBOARD PUPIL DETECTION

The way to get this running is a bit convoluted but it works. Do not ask me how.
To run this code:
1. run shell command """conda activate pypupilenv"""
2. run shell command """cd app_onboard"""
3. run shell command """sudo su"""
4. run shell command """~/.pyenv/versions/3.10.16/bin/python app.py"""


# THE REDO
from within the counterpilot_onboard folder, run ../.pyenv/versions/3.10.16/bin/python app.py

To setup, run pi-onboard-setup.sh from within counterpilot_onboard folder
